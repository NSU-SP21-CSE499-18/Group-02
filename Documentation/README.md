INTRODUCTION


Milk Basket is a startup-based idea which is a platform for different section of the people of the society to gather for business and welfare. It will be a website and app base platform to conjugate people respective towards their interest in the agro based products. Our headline of the project shows that it is related to milk. It will actually cover milk related periphery. It will ease the doing of business in this certain section. As there is a 6-million-ton shortage in production of milk per year in Bangladesh, our goal would be to suffice it by accelerating the process with our platform.
The intended audience would be the mass people who will be buying milk and domestic related products. The businesses who need tons of milk for their production, the farmers who need cattle feed and anyone who needs a vet for their pets and animals and lastly the investor who wants to invest in farms and share profit.


PROPOSED FEATURES 

Below are the tentative features, 
1. There are many features to implement in this project. As it is a milk related platform and our goal is to increase the production level of milk so we have introduced several features over here like cow farm, normal user, bulk user, farm sharing, milk product, animal doctor, cow food seller. 

 2. In these features there would be some sub features to support the idea over here, like under the cow farm there would be sub features like level, rating, review, farm, photo, available time, price, providing area, about farm and location. It would create a profile for the cow farm owner. It will boost the confidence among buyers and one of the most important aspect of going digital is transparency which would meet its goal.



3. The next feature would consist of normal user and bulk user. It would have some sub feature as well like rating, review, location, photo.





4. One of the important features is going to be the farm sharing one where the investor can find their farm holders with low capitals and experience. By investing here, they can get the benefit as well like sharing profit. The main idea would be to enhance production so through this we can penetrate through the ground level as well. There will be some sub features like farm level, rating, review, location, farm size, farm photo, number of cows etc. 
5.  Milk product is another feature for the user of this website from which he or she can order their expected product. The farms can put their dairy products for selling as well over here. There would be some feature like which farm product, product review, price and availability.
6. Animal doctor would be another feature where it would have some sub feature to ensure the safety of the animals. It would have sub features like level, rating, review, photo, certified, experience, available time, service charge, service providing area etc.
7. Cow food seller is another feature under which there would be some sub feature like level, rating, review, photo, food photo, food price, food expire date, food supply area etc.

 SOCIAL BENEFITS

1. Making ease of doing business in this area by going digital.

4. One of our important goal was to change the dynamics of production cycle of milk in our country. We can enhance the production and help our country making it rich. 
 
 PLANS FOR MONETIZATION
     
   We will mainly follow two types of monetization strategy,
  
  Freemium: The freemium strategy is considered to be the most effective way to monetize this website and app. This website and app will be provided to the users as a freemium version, and it will be completely free to use. We are going to make the money by taking some commission from the farm sharing user from both sides. There will be advertisement as well. 
  
  Premium: Through premium strategy the user can get the reach of most of the people. It will be like linked in strategy. If you subscribe the premium one then you can reach to the most of the people and there would be no advertisement then.

# 1.Introduction

**Purpose**

The purpose of Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to specify the description and specification for our web application and mobile application"Milk Basket". This document will clearly point out what we want to do with our project, how the client will interact with the system, and how the admin will interact with it, also other developers will have a clear idea about our project when they go through this SRS and we can modify it later on.

**Document Conventions**

**Main Title:** Font: Times, Face: Bold, Size 18

**Sub Section Title:** Font: Times, Face: Bold, Size 14

**Other Explanations:** Font: Calibri, Face: Normal, Size: 12

**Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions**

The intended audiences are Clients, Developers, and Project Manager who will evaluate this project. Keeping readability in mind, we have not used any technical terms in this SRS of our project so that everybody can understand it properly. In addition, we have made this system a single vendor system for simplicity's sake. For proper understanding, a reader should start sequentially as mentioned in the table of contents.

  
 **Product Scope**

The purpose of this web and mobile application is to make it easier for people to order food especially, during this pandemic period. Also, our objective is to make the user interface accessible to every age of people so that even an old person can easily get what he or she wants if that person has access to the internet. Most of the current similar type applications do not offer that much flexibility.


**Risk Definition**

The web and mobile application has some restrictions in its usability. A customer cannot add a product to their wish-list, they have to add the product directly to the cart. Customers can only search a product by its name, not by its rating. Finally, if the price of a product changes after a customer buys it, then the system will not generate an alert signal for the customer.
